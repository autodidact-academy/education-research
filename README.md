I am Researching autodidactic education advantages to hopefully encourage more companies 
to make degree requirements **optional** rather than mandatory. 

As a self-taught engineer I am attempting to adovocate Equal Opportunity for Self-Taught people who had insurmountable challenges in life that prevented us from completing a degree.

I'm currently still collecting the data and writing the analysis code,
but here are my initial findings:

## Socioeconomic Disparities
When a degree is required‚Äîparticularly a four-year, on-campus degree‚Äîlow-income and marginalized students face higher financial and logistical hurdles. The policy of requiring degrees systematically excludes:
- Students who lack the generational wealth to afford tuition without high debt.
- First-generation college attendees, who often juggle more obligations and enter with less preparatory support.
- Those with health or family circumstances making full-time study unrealistic.

## Irrelevance of Degree Content and the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve

#### Misalignment with Labor Market Demands
Many graduates do not end up in jobs directly related to their field of study. In addition, data show that employers increasingly value specific skills‚Äîtechnical or soft‚Äîover broad academic credentials (Burning Glass, 2020).

#### Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve
Psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus demonstrated that without ongoing reinforcement, humans forget a substantial portion of new information within days to weeks (Ebbinghaus, 1885). Consequently, large swaths of degree coursework may be forgotten quickly if not immediately applied in a professional setting, rendering much of the time and cost inefficient.

## Chronic Stress, Allostasis, and Allostatic Load

#### Key Concepts
- Allostasis: The process of maintaining internal stability by adjusting to challenges (Sterling & Eyer, 1988).
- Allostatic Load: The cumulative ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù on the body‚Äôs systems due to repeated exposure to stressors (McEwen, 1998).

#### Degree Requirements as Chronic Stressors
For young adults whose brains are still developing until roughly age 25‚Äì26 (Johnson et al., 2009), the pressure to attend college‚Äîoften under risk of future job insecurity if they opt out‚Äîcan result in chronic activation of the Hypothalamic‚ÄìPituitary‚ÄìAdrenal (HPA) axis. Elevated cortisol levels over long periods have been linked to:
- Impairments in memory and learning due to hippocampal atrophy.
- Higher rates of anxiety and depression (Lupien et al., 2009).
- Increased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders.
- Young people who are forced by social or familial pressure into degree programs may experience diminished mental health and cognitive resilience‚Äîoutcomes worsened when they must also juggle part-time jobs, caretaking - responsibilities, or heavy loan burdens.

# This is ongoing research I plan to work on 1 or 2 days per month
I hope to have this research completed in less than a year, but maybe not.
